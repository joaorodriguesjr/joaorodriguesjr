Self taught programmer messing with web technologies since 2010. Currently focused on full stack Javascript and devops tools like Docker, Kubernetes and CI/CD pipelines to manage development and production environments.

Also interested in low level programming, blockchains and smart contracts as i study and experiment with them on my spare time.
