# Hi, my name is Jo√£o Rodrigues Jr!

I'm a self taught programmer based in Brazil. I started my journey on programming making stuff with web technologies in 2010. Currently i really like to work full stack with Javascript and some devops tools like Docker, Kubernetes and CI/CD pipelines to help me with my development and production environments.

I'm also interested in some low level stuff and Blockchain technologies like EVM compatible networks and smart contracts as i study and experiment with it on my spare time.
