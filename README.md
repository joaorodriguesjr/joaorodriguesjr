Self taught programmer making stuff with web technologies since 2010. Currently working full stack with Javascript and devops tools like Docker, Kubernetes and CI/CD pipelines to manage development and production environments.

Also interested in low level stuff and blockchains with smart contracts as i study and experiment with them on my spare time.
